	<h2 class="visually-hidden">About</h2>
	<p>When I was 12 years old, my uncle gave me a point and shoot camera. Since then I have never stopped taking pictures, with the exception of the years 2020–2023, when I also struggled to find a place to call home.</p>

	<p>I built this website for family, friends, and anyone who lands here to enjoy my photos. I never replaced <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/personal/deactivated-my-instagram-account">Instagram when I quit my account in January 2021</a>: this website is now my own platform. In no way I consider myself a photographer, even if <a href="https://silviamaggidesign.com/tag/shutter-hub">I took part in a few exhibitions</a>.</p>

	<p>I currently shoot with a Fujifilm X-T20 with a Fujifilm XF 35mm f/2 R WR lens. Sometimes I equip the camera with a Helios-M44 lens, which creates the famously “magical” bokeh effect.</p>

	<p>The Helios lens came with the Zenit TTL, which is the trusted family camera that documented my childhood and early teenage years. I also own a Dacora Dignette S-L, generously given to me by my in-laws. I’m a nostalgic.</p>

	<p>Despite the above technical details, I’m not showing any on the website. I’d rather you look at the pictures and decide what they mean without distractions.</p>

	<p>All the photos are mine, including editing. Get in touch if you wish a print, I’d be happy to help.</p>
